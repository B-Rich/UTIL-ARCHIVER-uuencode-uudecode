uuencode/uudecode for OS/2
Compiled under Virtual Pascal/2 by Sean Dennis

NOTE:
  This is something that I picked up off of the Internet.
  I simply recompiled it for Windows, OS/2 and DOS binaries... I
  cannot guarentee that it will work.  These programs
  are public domain.  I do hope these work for you as
  they have come in quite handy for me.

Brief description:
            The original author of this code is unknown. The code is without
            comments and was slightly hacked when I got it. After a few simple
            changes from TP3.0? syntax and other strangely obvious problems -
            I got the code to work. If someone wants to polish it up a bit and
            tweak it - feel free. I am not the original author and have made
            modifications myself.    

 Usage:
        uuencode <target> <destination>  converts binary to ascii

        uudecode <target> --> the destination file is described in the ascii
                              encoded file header
